# Websocket

## What is Websocket?

WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. WebSocket is designed to be implemented in web browsers and web servers, but it can be used by any client or server application. The WebSocket Protocol is an independent TCP-based protocol. Its only relationship to HTTP is that its handshake is interpreted by HTTP servers as an Upgrade request.

## Advantages of Websocket

1. Real-time data transfer
2. Bi-directional communication
3. Efficient
4. Low latency
5. Persistent connection


## Use Cases

- Chat applications
- Real-Time gaming
- Collaborative editing
- Live updates
- IoT applications
- Stock market applications

## Websocket vs HTTP

- Http is a request-response protocol with unidirectional communication that means the client sends a request, and the server sends back a response, while Websocket is a full-duplex communication protocol, that means it requires a request for communication and the server accepts it and sends back a HandShake then the bidirectional communication (communication is done in a simple thread) starts.
